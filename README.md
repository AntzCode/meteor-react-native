# react-native-meteor

## Updated version of the react-native-meteor, compatible with React Native 0.60+

**ATTENTION:** The following features from the original react-native-meteor library have been removed:
- cursoredFind is no longer an option. All .find() calls will return cursors (to match Meteor)
